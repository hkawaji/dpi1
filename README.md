Decomposition-based peak identification (DPI)
=============================================

This tool identifies a set of reference peaks in in genome-wide TSS (transcription
starting site) profiles obtained from diverse range of biological states. In
particular, this is developed for the FANTOM5 project (Nature 507, 462-467, 2014
and its related papers) that produced CAGE profiles in more than one thousand of
biological states in human and mouse, and the analysis results have been
available at http://fantom.gsc.riken.jp/5/ as well as the article above.

In general, I recommend to use the FANTOM5 peak set for CAGE analysis, rather
than runnning this tool for your own data, so that you can compare your results
with others. I would recommend to run this tool to identify a set of TSS peaks in
other organisms than human and mouse, or very unique biological conditions not
included in the FANTOM5 sample collecttion.
